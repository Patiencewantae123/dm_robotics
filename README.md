### Supported Python Versions 🐍

- Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10 are supported.

## Dependencies ⚙️

Some packages have specific dependencies:
- **MuJoCo** is required for `MoMa`, `Manipulation`, and `Controllers`.
- Other packages do not have additional dependencies beyond standard libraries like **NumPy**.

Refer to the individual packages' documentation for detailed information on their dependencies.

## Building the Libraries 🛠️

To build and test the libraries, you can use the provided `build.sh` script. This script assumes the following prerequisites:

### Prerequisites:
- [`dm_control`](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control) is installed.
- **CMake** version >= 3.20.2.
- Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 with system headers installed.
- **GCC** version 9 or later installed.
- **NumPy** installed.

### Build & Test Steps 🔄:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run `build.sh` to compile the C++ components and run the tests.

For more details, refer to the individual package documentation for specific setup and usage instructions.
